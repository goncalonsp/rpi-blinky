A simple LED Blinker in [GO](https://golang.org/) using the [EMBD library](https://github.com/kidoman/embd) to drive the GPIO pins.

This blinker program was testing using a setup with a Raspberry Pi Zero, a Red LED (about 1.7 voltage drop) driven by pin GPIO_4 and a current limiting resistor of 100 Ohms.
